### CPSC 120

  * Lab 2

    Lab 2, part 1 was one of my favorite labs because it was my first
    experience with hands-on coding. Prior to that lab, I had no
    knowledge of how to code so it was fascinating to see the process
    of compiling code. This lab was also where I was introduced how to
    use git and continued to use that knowledge for future labs.

  * Lab 3

    Lab 3, part 1 is another favorite lab of mine because I liked creating
    my own sandwich. Inserting my protein, bread, and condiment of choice
    was fun and seeing my sandwich made in the output. This specific lab
    made me realize how code can be implemented into things I didn't
    realize they were implemented in like how a program like this could
    be part of an ordering app. I realized more of how coding is incorporated
    into society.

  * Lab 12

    Lab 12, part 1 was a favorite lab since I really enjoyed seeing the
    results of an animated gradient image. I was astonished at how the
    three different channels of red, green, and blue, were able to create
    one image showing many different colors and shades. The separation of
    channels helped me learn how to visualize the process of compiling
    code more. I'm glad that the semester ended with a lab with a pretty
    outcome.
